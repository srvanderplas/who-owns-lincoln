<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="primary-question-who-owns-lincoln">Primary Question: Who Owns Lincoln?</h2>
<p>In order to promote action on housing affordability in Lancaster County, it is important to understand who the players are: to build consensus, we will need cooperation between government entities, landlords, and tenants. Right now, it is the landlords who are the unknown quantity: are most units in Lancaster county owned by small-time landlords with 1-3 single units or duplexes? Or is the rental space dominated primarily by large, out of state investment companies?</p>
<p>All sources of data at the county level will be incomplete in some way: the property tax data does not indicate whether a home is used as a rental property or is owner-occupied. Large landlords may be more likely to have properties which are registered with the city housing authority, but this is not a guarantee.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-sources">Data Sources</h2>
<p>Data contributing to this analysis is described in <a href="property-data-description.qmd">Property Data Description</a>. Data supporting maps was sourced from a number of public resources provided by the state of Nebraska and Lancaster county. Property assessment parcel data was obtained from the county assessor’s office. Parcel GIS data was obtained from https://maps.lincoln.ne.gov/default/index.html?viewer=GISViewer using systematic manual downloads with the draw rectangle tool; some parcels did not have corresponding GIS information, either due to the manual nature of the download or due to mismatches within the different databases; this missingness should only affect displayed maps.</p>

<p>The property tax data includes the owner’s address as well as the site address; it stands to reason that if the owner occupies the premises, the owner’s address will match the site address. Not all entries have a site address, however, most entries without a site address are unimproved properties, as shown in <span class="citation" data-cites="missing-site-addr-summary">@missing-site-addr-summary</span>. Unimproved properties do not have buildings and thus most likely do not contain current residents, and so, for the purposes of this analysis, we can ignore these properties.</p>

While there are missing/unassigned addresses across all categories, missing addresses are primarily found in unimproved properties, which are unlikely to have residents. IOLL is an acronym for ‘improvement on leased land’, where the renter adds an improvement, such as a building or shed, and the renter is taxed for the improvement while the landowner pays taxes on the land separately.</figcaption>

<p>Assessment of impact of missing site addresses for Improved/IOLL properties.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This analysis proceeds ignoring unimproved properties and with the assumption that properties without a specified address are a relatively small contribution to the overall analysis.</p>
<p>As acreages are typically classed as residential properties even when in agricultural areas, we will remove agricultural areas from the remainder of the analysis unless they are classed as acreages. Not all commercial buildings will be apartments; of the commercial building classifications in the data set, the following appear to be “residential” or at least partially residential in nature:</p>
<ul>
<li>01-Apartment</li>
<li>02-Student Apartment</li>
<li>03-Senior and Community Living</li>
<li>04-Hotel/Motel</li>
<li>29-Residence on Commercial Account</li>
<li>50-Fraternity House</li>
<li>51-Nursing Home</li>
<li>58-Apt over Commercial</li>
<li>63-Community Living</li>
<li>90-Mobile Home Courts</li>
</ul>
<p>The following analysis considers only commercial properties with the above classifications.</p>
<p>If the first owner address field (<code>Own_Address1</code>) is at least partially contained within the site address (<code>SitusAddress</code>), then the property is considered owner-occupied. For example, if the Owner’s address is listed as <code>6121 S 97 ST</code>, and the Site address is listed as <code>6121 S 97TH ST, LINCOLN, NE  68526</code>, the property would be considered owner-occupied.</p>

<section id="owner-types" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="owner-types">Owner Types</h2>
<p>One interesting facet of this data is that properties can be owned by many different types of entities - individuals, LLCs, incorporated companies, life estates, and trusts, among others. While it is certainly possible for a house to be owned by a trust and not rented out (e.g.&nbsp;for estate planning purposes), it seems reasonable to create a variable indicating whether residential properties are owned by an individual/single family. To do this, we will flag any property where the Owner name includes acronyms such as INC, LLC, LLP, LTD, and LP, or words such as community, company, corp, authority, university, investment, or apartments.</p>
<p>A separate variable will be created to flag properties which are owned by estates and trusts - these properties may be investment vehicles (e.g.&nbsp;in the case of a family trust which generates income from real estate investment/rental properties), but are also commonly used for estate planning and/or providing for relatives who depend on social programs such as SSDI, SSI, and Medicare/Medicaid. One exception to this classification is if the owner name contains ‘real estate’, which would indicate ownership by a company rather than the type of family investment situation we hope to examine.</p>

</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We can see from <span class="citation" data-cites="owner-investment-summary">@owner-investment-summary</span> that most properties owned by LLCs/corporations are not owner-occupied, but that approximately half of those owned by estates/trusts are owner-occupied, and about 3/5 of the properties owned by individuals are owner-occupied.</p>
</section>
<section id="properties-per-owner" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="properties-per-owner">Properties per Owner</h2>
<p>Examining the properties per owner is somewhat difficult, in part because some parcels list multiple owners and some owners have multiple parcels, and to make this more complicated, parcels can be combined to host a single house (think of situations where someone buys an adjacent lot to use as a yard in close-packed neighborhoods). This is all to say that any attempts to estimate the number of properties per owner will have edge cases that are counted incorrectly. In order to account for parcels with multiple owners and houses that have multiple parcels, a weight value was calculated such that for each unique parcel with the same site address, the weight for that parcel/address combination was 1, and for each unique site address, the weight for the address itself was 1. So a single address split into 2 parcels, where one parcel has 2 owners would have weight values (.5, .25, .25). These weight values are then used in the calculation of number of properties; this creates fractional properties that hopefully provide a better estimate given the peculiarities of the existing data.</p>
<p>Then, we remove any properties which are owner-occupied and where the owner has only one unit. That is, an owner-occupied complex with 8 units would still be included in this data set of units which are likely available for rent. <span class="citation" data-cites="properties-per-owner">@properties-per-owner</span> shows the distribution of property ownership for non-owner-occupied properties in Lancaster county. There are &lt;200 entities who own 4-5 properties, and the number of entities at each level of property ownership decreases sharply as the number of properties increases.</p>

<p>In many situations, it is important to assess how much outreach an organization could do with the available resources; as a result, it is also important to determine how much of Lancaster county’s properties are owned by “large landlords” - for the purposes of this assessment, landlords who own at least 0.05% of the properties in the county.
