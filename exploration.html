<p>Justice in Action adopted a 3rd advocacy area in 2023 - Affordable housing. One of the most promising areas to tackle is the application fee/background check fee, which must be paid to each landlord with no guarantee of acceptance and no refunds. In order to propose a more just system, Justice in Action needs to understand who might be affected by different proposed solutions - in other words, who owns rental housing in Lincoln?</p>
<p>There are several potential avenues for public data which might help answer this question:</p>
<ul>
<li>property tax/assessment records,</li>
<li>rental registration records,</li>
</ul>
<p>Of primary interest is to determine whether housing is owned by:</p>
<ul>
<li>LLCs or individuals</li>
<li>in-state vs.&nbsp;out-of-state owners</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, it would be good to figure out how many units each owner operates (potentially) to assess the feasibility of working with e.g.&nbsp;the largest N landlords who own 80% or more of housing in Lincoln.</p>

<p>A map of Nebraska roads was obtained from Nebraska’s <a href="https://www.nebraskamap.gov/datasets/dc69abca3b1a43749dea2141a3544bc9_0/explore">open data site</a> to provide contextual cues for generated maps. Smaller roads were added from Lancaster county’s <a href="https://opendata.lincoln.ne.gov/datasets/a7dae9fff57a4c978084dd46cb287006/explore?location=40.773129%2C-96.760113%2C15.26">street data</a>.</p>

Municipal boundaries were sourced from <a href="https://www.nebraskamap.gov/datasets/ecc5102303b948aea73b0b4ebcce66b0_0/explore">state records</a> and added for additional context.</p>

<p>Two xlsx files were acquired from Doug R. Guess of the Lancaster County GIS office on 2024-03-13; the total cost of the database search was $60 (+ $2 processing fee). The information is publicly available at https://app.lincoln.ne.gov/aspx/cnty/cto/, but assembling the full dataset would require assembling data from approximately 1.7576^{4} queries; it was deemed reasonable to pay for the data rather than assemble it manually.</p>
<ul>
<li>data/SusanVanderplas.xlsx contains 126479 rows and 126479 columns, including the following columns not present in the initial data file: PrimeUseDesc, PrimeUse, Situs, Prop_ClassDesc, Total_Acres</li>
<li>data/SusanVanderplas-New.xlsx contains 128511 rows and 128511 columns, including the following columns not present in the initial data file: PrimaryUseDesc, SitusAddress, PropertyClassDesc, TotalAcres, ComBldgNo, ComBldgTypeDesc, ComNoUnits</li>
</ul>
<p>Further analysis shows that</p>
<ul>
<li><code>PrimeUseDesc</code> and <code>PrimaryUseDesc</code> have the same 28 levels (and are thus most likely duplicated columns)</li>
<li><code>Prop_ClassDesc</code> and <code>PropertyClassDesc</code> have the same 8 levels</li>
</ul>
<p>Joining the two datasets on common variables allowed verification that (<code>TotalAcres</code>, <code>Total_Acres</code>) and (<code>SitusAddress</code>, <code>Situs</code>) contain the same information. In addition, joining the two datasets on all variables did not produce any non-matching rows, indicating that <code>data/SusanVanderPlas.xlsx</code> contains a subset of the data present in <code>data/SusanVanderPlas-New.xlsx</code>. What is curious is that <code>data/SusanVanderPlas-New.xlsx</code> contains more rows and columns than <code>data/SusanVanderplas.xlsx</code> but takes up approximately 0.3 MB less space on disk.</p>
<p>After joining the two data tables to ensure that the maximum information available is analyzed, there are 128511 records with 39 available variables.</p>

<p>Breaking this summary down, we can see associations between variable missingness, which likely occurs due to the difference between residential and commercial properties, assessments, and valuation. Examining this hypothesis with a 10% sample of the data, clustering observations by missingness, we can see there is a group of observations that is largely missing the assessment information for residential housing, such as <code>ResTypeDesc</code>, …, <code>GarageCap</code>, but these observations are more likely to have <code>ComBldgNo</code>, …, <code>ComNoUnits</code>; there is also a group which seems to lack both sets of information.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="primary-question-who-owns-lincoln">Primary Question: Who Owns Lincoln?</h2>
<p>In order to promote action on housing affordability in Lancaster County, it is important to understand who the players are: to build consensus, we will need cooperation between government entities, landlords, and tenants. Right now, it is the landlords who are the unknown quantity: are most units in Lancaster county owned by small-time landlords with 1-3 single units or duplexes? Or is the rental space dominated primarily by large, out of state investment companies?</p>
<p>All sources of data at the county level will be incomplete in some way: the property tax data does not indicate whether a home is used as a rental property or is owner-occupied. Large landlords may be more likely to have properties which are registered with the city housing authority, but this is not a guarantee.</p>
<section id="property-tax-data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="property-tax-data">Property Tax Data</h3>
<p>The property tax data includes the owner’s address as well as the site address; it stands to reason that if the owner occupies the premises, the owner’s address will match the site address. Not all entries have a site address, however, most entries without a site address are unimproved properties, as shown in <strong>?@fig-missing-site-addr-summary</strong>. Unimproved properties do not have buildings and thus most likely do not contain current residents, and so, for the purposes of this analysis, we can ignore these properties.</p>

While there are missing/unassigned addresses across all categories, missing addresses are primarily found in unimproved properties, which are unlikely to have residents. IOLL is an acronym for ‘improvement on leased land’, where the renter adds an improvement, such as a building or shed, and the renter is taxed for the improvement while the landowner pays taxes on the land separately.</figcaption>

<p>This analysis proceeds ignoring unimproved properties and with the assumption that properties without a specified address are a relatively small contribution to the overall analysis. In addition, as acreages are typically classed as residential properties even when in agricultural areas, we will remove agricultural areas from the remainder of the analysis unless they are classed as acreages. Not all commercial buildings will be apartments; of the commercial building classifications in the data set, the following appear to be “residential” or at least partially residential in nature:</p>
<ul>
<li>01-Apartment</li>
<li>02-Student Apartment</li>
<li>03-Senior and Community Living</li>
<li>04-Hotel/Motel</li>
<li>29-Residence on Commercial Account</li>
<li>50-Fraternity House</li>
<li>51-Nursing Home</li>
<li>58-Apt over Commercial</li>
<li>63-Community Living</li>
<li>90-Mobile Home Courts</li>
</ul>
<p>Restricting commercial properties to these classifications, we have the following breakdown of owner-occupied and not-owner-occupied buildings. While this data still includes properties without a site address, these are a tiny fraction of the overall data.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="exploring-owner-types">Exploring Owner Types</h2>
<p>One interesting facet of this data is that properties can be owned by many different types of entities - individuals, LLCs, incorporated companies, life estates, and trusts, among others. While it is certainly possible for a house to be owned by a trust and not rented out (e.g.&nbsp;for estate planning purposes), it seems reasonable to develop a variable indicating whether residential properties are owned by an individual entity or not. To do this, we will flag any property where the Owner name includes ” INC”, ” LLC”, “authority”, or “corporation”. A separate indicator variable will be created to flag properties which are owned by estates and trusts - these properties may be investment vehicles (e.g.&nbsp;in the case of a family trust which generates income from real estate investment/rental properties), but more commonly are used for estate planning and/or providing for relatives who depend on social programs such as SSDI, SSI, and Medicare/Medicaid.</p>

</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We can see from <strong>?@fig-owner-investment-summary</strong> that most properties owned by LLCs/corporations are not owner-occupied, but that approximately half of those owned by estates/trusts are owner-occupied, and about 3/5 of the properties owned by individuals are owner-occupied.</p>
</section>
<section id="exploring-properties-per-owner" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="exploring-properties-per-owner">Exploring Properties per Owner</h2>
<p>Examining the properties per owner is somewhat difficult, in part because some parcels list multiple owners and some owners have multiple parcels, and to make this more complicated, parcels can be combined to host a single house (think of situations where someone buys an adjacent, empty lot to use as a yard in close-packed houses). This is all to say that any attempts to estimate the number of properties per owner will have edge cases that are counted incorrectly. In order to account for parcels with multiple owners and houses that have multiple parcels, a weight value was calculated such that for each unique parcel with the same site address, the weight for that parcel/address combination was 1, and for each unique site address, the weight for the address itself was 1. So a single address split into 2 parcels, where one parcel has 2 owners would have weight values (.5, .25, .25). These weight values are then used in the calculation of number of properties; this creates fractional properties that hopefully provide a better estimate given the peculiarities of the existing data.</p>
<p>Then, we remove any properties which are owner-occupied and where the owner has only one unit. That is, an owner-occupied complex with 8 units would still be included in this data set of units which are likely available for rent. <strong>?@fig-properties-per-owner</strong> shows the distribution of property ownership for non-owner-occupied properties in Lancaster county. There are &lt;200 entities who own 4-5 properties, and the number of entities at each level of property ownership decreases sharply as the number of properties increases.</p>
